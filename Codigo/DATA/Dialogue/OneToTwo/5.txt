Simone: So! Moving on! You see, you just died, actually you were MURDERED, by who you might ask, 
I am an intangible imaginary friend and we imaginary friends never take part in human messy stuff… 
don’t look at me like that, it wasn’t me! You wanna know who did it? Just go through your fading 
memories as a ghost until you get to your end, there will you find the answer.
