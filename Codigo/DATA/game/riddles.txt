What flies...*#

without...*#

wings?*#

Tear one off...*#

and scratch my head.*#

what was black,
is red instead!*#

Voiceless it cries,*#

Wingless flutters*#

Toothless bites,
mouthless mutters!*#

Who makes it, 
has no need of it*#

Who buys it,
has no use for it*#

Who uses it,
can neither see not feel it*#
