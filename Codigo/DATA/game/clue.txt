Although It is not something physical, we all can feel it pass. I’m trying this to rhyme, just give me a bit more...mind?|
Little and powerful, I could burn your house if you light me.|
With no lungs it blows, the leaves of the trees and the burning coal. If you are not careful enough, it might also blow your soul.|
If everything goes right, need it not, you might. What we all run from can’t be avoided. The final prision cell to the eternal night.|
